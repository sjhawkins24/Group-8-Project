    "\n",
    "### Making Predictions:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from PredictRankings import predict_rank_change\n",
    "\n",
    "result = predict_rank_change(\n",
    "    team_name=\"Ohio State\",\n",
    "    current_rank=5,\n",
    "    team_elo=1750,        # From elo_ratings_by_season.csv\n",
    "    opponent_elo=1680,    # From elo_ratings_by_season.csv\n",
